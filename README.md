in the i have used Getx on technology only saw the the email about using bloc as an option later when i was done
because of time i didnt have the time to include maps as i would have wanted , ive also noticed a boring bug after i pushed into gitHub
when you create city and save them the temp might show as 0 but soon as you click on that city it duplicates
and creates a new city with the actually temp
